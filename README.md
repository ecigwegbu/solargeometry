SOLARGEOMETRY CALCULATOR PROJECT

This project was initially an ALX Portfiolio Project. It has since evolved to
a lab to demonstrate some tech stacks and will thus grow with time.
That is, more features will be added to it from time to time.

The latest addition is the app containerisation using Docker and CI-CD with Jenkins. Details of the complete tech stack included in the project will be added in due course.

Thank you for your interest in the project.
