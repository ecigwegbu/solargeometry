  <h3>About Solar Geometry Factor</h3>
  <p>
    Solar Geometry Factor (SGF) reflects the proportion of the solar irradiance
    (solar energy per unit surface area) available at a given location, date and
    time on Earth, that would be incident on a solar panel. This factor is
    determined by the orientation of the panel relative to direct sunlight. The
    SGF is equal to the dot product of the unit vector pointing towards the sun
    and the unit normal vector of the surface of the solar panel.
  </p>
  <p>
    A panel directly facing the sun has a SGF of 1. For a horizontal panel on
    Earth, due to the rotational and orbital motions of the Earth, the SGF is
    affected by the latitude and longitude at the location, the date and the
    time. A panel mounted on a sloping roof can have a lower or higher SGF,
    compared to a horizontal panel at the same location, date and time,
    depending on whether that slope results in the panel tilting away from or
    towards the sun, respectively. For a horizontal panel at any given location,
    date and time, the SGF will increase from zero at sunrise, peaking at the
    location's solar noon on that date, and decreasing again to zero at sunset.
  </p>
  <p>
    Besides the SGF, there are several other factors that affect the amount of
    solar energy that can be generated by a solar panel, in addition to the
    panel's own efficiency. These include the atmospheric air mass, cloud cover,
    temperature and diffuse sunlight, e.g., at dawn and dusk; these need to be
    considered separately when designing a solar array for any application in
    practice. Nevertheless, the SGF gives a good indication of the geometric
    factors that will influence the design decisions.

  <h3>About Solar Geometry Calculator</h3>
  <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word; padding: 5px 5px">
    <em>Solar Geometry Calculator</em> was inspired by the experience of the
    developer in trying to help many people retrofit solar panels on their roof.
    The tool is handy for quickly assessing the impact of roof orientation,
    location, date and time on solar panel efficiency, especially at the project
    conceptual stage. The term Solar Geometry Factor" was also first coined by
    the developer, drawing from his years of experience in science and
    engineering practice. The tool has been developed in partial fulfilment of
    the requirements for a Software Engineering programme offered by
    <a href="https://www.alxafrica.com/software-engineering/">ALX-Africa</a>.
    The tool uses industry-standard libraries and APIs to ensure accurate
    results, notably the Google Geocoding and Time Zone APIs and models of the
    Earth and Sun published by the US National Oceanic & Atmospheric
    Administration. <br />
    The developer also offers high-end solar energy installation services for
    corporate clients and large organisations.
